# Latex stretch
## About

Latex stretch provides some templates for LaTeX. You can preview some of it in the `test` directory.

## Installation

There's 2 simple ways to use the templates.

* Simply copy the `.cls` file in your project's directory.
* Add or symlink the template to your LaTeX's templates folder. With MacTeX, this folder is `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex`.

When you've done one of these, use it as a class in your `.tex` file. To see which macros are available, you can modify the files in the `test`folder instead of creating a new empty file.
